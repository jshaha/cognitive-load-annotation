    "full_text": "<p>A groundbreaking study published in the Journal of Neuroscience has revealed new insights into how sleep affects memory consolidation. Researchers at Stanford University found that specific brain wave patterns during deep sleep play a crucial role in transferring information from short-term to long-term memory.</p><p>The study involved 120 participants who were asked to learn a series of word pairs before sleeping. Brain activity was monitored throughout the night using advanced EEG technology. The results showed that participants who experienced more slow-wave sleep demonstrated significantly better recall of the word pairs the following day.</p><p>\"This research confirms what we've suspected for years,\" said Dr. Sarah Chen, the lead researcher. \"Quality sleep isn't just about rest—it's an active process where the brain consolidates and organizes new information.\"</p><p>The findings have important implications for students and professionals who often sacrifice sleep to cram for exams or meet deadlines. The research suggests that getting adequate sleep after learning new material may be more beneficial than additional study time.</p>"

However, quantum bits, or qubits, are extremely sensitive to environmental interference, leading to high error rates that have limited practical applications.</p><p>The new error correction protocol, published in Nature, uses a technique called \"surface codes\" combined with novel machine learning algorithms to detect and correct errors in real-time. The system was tested on IBM's 127-qubit Eagle processor.</p><p>\"This is a fundamental step toward fault-tolerant quantum computing,\" said Dr. Jay Gambetta, IBM's Vice President of Quantum Computing. \"We're now entering a phase where quantum computers can begin tackling problems that matter.\"</p><p>Potential applications include drug discovery, financial modeling, and cryptography. However, experts caution that widespread commercial adoption remains years away, as significant engineering challenges persist.</p><p>The achievement has reignited the race among tech giants, with Google, Microsoft, and various startups all pursuing different approaches to quantum computing supremacy.</p>"

The findings, published in the journal Science, indicate that the Arctic could experience ice-free summers as early as 2035, a decade sooner than previously predicted.</p><p>The study analyzed ice thickness and extent data collected over the past 40 years. Researchers found that not only is the total ice coverage shrinking, but the remaining ice is significantly thinner than in previous decades, making it more vulnerable to seasonal melting.</p><p>\"What we're seeing is a feedback loop,\" explained Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a climate scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"As ice melts, it exposes darker ocean water, which absorbs more heat, which causes more melting.\"</p><p>The implications extend far beyond the Arctic region. Accelerated ice melt contributes to rising sea levels, threatens polar wildlife, and disrupts global weather patterns. Indigenous communities in the Arctic are already experiencing significant impacts on their traditional ways of life.</p><p>The research adds urgency to international climate negotiations, with scientists calling for more aggressive emission reduction targets. Current pledges under the Paris Agreement are considered insufficient to prevent the most severe consequences of Arctic warming.</p>"

Mayor Anne Hidalgo of Paris has been a prominent advocate, implementing extensive pedestrian zones and bike lanes throughout the French capital.</p><p>Key elements of the 15-minute city include mixed-use zoning that allows residential, commercial, and recreational spaces to coexist; enhanced public transportation; and the conversion of parking spaces into green areas and community facilities.</p><p>Critics argue that the concept is impractical for lower-density cities and could increase housing costs in newly desirable neighborhoods. Some have also raised concerns about potential restrictions on car usage.</p><p>\"The 15-minute city isn't about banning cars,\" clarified Carlos Moreno, the Sorbonne professor who popularized the term. \"It's about giving people choices and reducing the need for long commutes.\"</p><p>Economic studies suggest that 15-minute neighborhoods can boost local businesses, reduce traffic congestion, and improve public health outcomes.
