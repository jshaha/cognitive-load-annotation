    "full_text": "<p>A groundbreaking study published in the Journal of Neuroscience has revealed new insights into how sleep affects memory consolidation. Researchers at Stanford University found that specific brain wave patterns during deep sleep play a crucial role in transferring information from short-term to long-term memory.</p><p>The study involved 120 participants who were asked to learn a series of word pairs before sleeping. Brain activity was monitored throughout the night using advanced EEG technology. The results showed that participants who experienced more slow-wave sleep demonstrated significantly better recall of the word pairs the following day.</p><p>\"This research confirms what we've suspected for years,\" said Dr. Sarah Chen, the lead researcher. \"Quality sleep isn't just about rest—it's an active process where the brain consolidates and organizes new information.\"</p><p>The findings have important implications for students and professionals who often sacrifice sleep to cram for exams or meet deadlines. The research suggests that getting adequate sleep after learning new material may be more beneficial than additional study time.</p>"

But what exactly causes prices to rise, and why has this episode proven so persistent?</p><p>At its core, inflation occurs when too much money chases too few goods. The pandemic created a perfect storm: governments injected trillions in stimulus while supply chains contracted and consumer spending patterns shifted dramatically.</p><p>The initial surge was concentrated in goods like cars and appliances. As pandemic restrictions eased, inflation spread to services—restaurants, travel, and housing. This \"stickier\" service inflation has proven harder to tame.</p><p>Central banks responded with the sharpest interest rate increases in decades. Higher rates make borrowing more expensive, cooling demand for homes, cars, and business investment. The theory is straightforward; the practice is fraught with timing challenges.</p><p>\"Monetary policy works with long and variable lags,\" explained former Fed economist Susan Chen. \"The full impact of rate hikes won't be felt for 12-18 months.\"</p><p>Consumers have adapted in various ways—trading down to store brands, reducing discretionary spending, and taking on additional work.
